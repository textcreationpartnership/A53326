            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <hi>AL thy wayes are juſt, Oh dear Father, and thy judgments are true alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For worthily doth man live in the ſweat of his face, and the woman bring forth children with much pain and travel, and with great danger. Yea, O mercifull Father, this pain is not a ſufficient puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the grievous tranſgreſſions wherewith we and our fore-fathers have tranſgreſſed thy moſt holy will. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in reſpect of our demerits too ſmal, but in reſpect of our weakneſſe too great for us without thee to endure. Wherefore as I acknowledge, O mercifull Father, this travel in child-birth, which now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to be a juſt reward of my manifold ſins, ſo I acknowledge alſo thy ready Arm of defence, ſtretched out over me, and over all them that call upon thee in faith. Grant therefore O dear Father, that I may pray in faith, and patiently wait for that time of my travel, that I may thankefully and conſtantly endure it when it ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
<pb facs="tcp:47058:11"/>knowing that though I then feel ſome taſt of the reward of ſin, yet I feel not all; and that little which I then feel, thou doſt preſently reward with comfort and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when a child is born into the world. The which comfortable and glad iſſue, grant me, O Lord, if it be thy good pleaſure, and having received ſuch fruit of my body; grant me moreover wiſedom and ſtrength to bring it up in thy fear, and to travel (as it were) again with it, till it be born again into a heavenly life, to the glory of thy holy name, and my greater joy: that ſo it may finally in Chriſt Jeſus be partaker of thoſe bleſſings, which thou doſt plentifully rain down upon the faithfull and their ſeed for ever. And becauſe I am not worthy to preſent this my ſuit to thy heavenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of my ſelf, a moſt wretched and ſinfull woman, I offer it in the name, in the righteouſneſſe, and in the ſtrength of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, praying furthermore as he taught us to pray, Our father &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obſervable, that the great God, who is equally infinite in all his Attributes, yet hath ſtyled himſelf, <hi>rich in mercy, glorious in holineſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 86.15 Eph. 2.4. Exod. 15.11.</note> Surely he needs neither riches nor glory; He was rich enough to Himſelf, and glorious enough in Himſelf from everlaſting. But behold, His <hi>good Will towards men,</hi> and the communicative nature of infinite goodneſs. Mercy enricheth us, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs glorifies us. By Mercy we partake of his Gifts, by Holineſs we partake of his Nature. By Mercy we enjoy him, by Holineſs we love him, reſemble him, and glorifie him for ever. Now ſeeing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47058:17"/>theſe two tranſcendent perfections do eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally cohabite in the nature of God, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually concur to the benefit of man; it is moſt requiſite that our minds ſhould be filled with the thoughts &amp; influences of both. That is, that each Mercy of God ſhould promote our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and that Holineſs ſhould encreaſe our ſenſe of Mercies. It being therefore my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs, that women with child may be <hi>in a holy frame,</hi> and <hi>thereby fitted for the houre of danger approaching,</hi> I thought good to mind them of this firſt, that 'tis a mercy of much value to be with child in a ſtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>That this is a mercy, will appear plainly by theſe few conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis one end of marriage, that there might be a ſucceſsion of generation after ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that the race of mankind may not be confuſed, and diſorderly, as among Beaſts; nor extinguiſhed,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.4</note> nor diſhonoured; but may continue in a legitimate line, and that God might have a <hi>holy ſeed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2.15.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it might appear to be a Mercy, God hath, by Angels, Revelations and Miracles, at ſundry times, of old, aſſured ſome good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that he would give this bleſſing to their wombs. Thus, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16. <hi>I will bleſs her, &amp; give thee a ſon alſo of her;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17.16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>yea I will bleſs her, and ſhe ſhall be a mother alſo of nations.</hi> Though upon this ſtrange promiſe we find <hi>Abraham</hi> full of wondering, ver. 17. and <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47058:17"/>laughing, ch. 18 12. Both queſtioning, at firſt, how this could be, yet afterwards God doth renew his promiſe, and they lay aſide any further doubt; and <hi>the word of the Lord ſpoken by angels was falfilled,</hi> Gen. 21.1. <hi>The Lord viſited Sarah, as he had ſaid, and did unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah as he had ſpoken, For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a ſon in his old age, at the ſet time of which God had ſpoken to him.</hi> We find of the Patriarchs alſo, that they found favour with God in like manner, concerning the fruit of their womb, ever acknowledging it as the gift of God, and adoring the gracious providence of the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Nihil de genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus aut ſeminibus nvſcitur, ſi ea non ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur Deus. <hi>Aug. in Pſ. 118. Gen. 28.</hi>
                  </note> God and Father of all men. When they bleſſed their poſteriy they carefully inſerted this in their propheticall prayers. <hi>This laſt bleſſing of a dying Patriarch, though it be ſometime, or in ſome part expreſſed in form of petition, yet in the intent and effect thereof alway amounted to a prediction.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Jacob, God Almighty bleſſe thee and make thee fruit full, and multiply thee, that thou mayeſt be a multitude of people.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph: Joſeph is a fruitfull bough,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 49. 22.25.</note> 
                  <hi>even a fruitfull bough, whoſe branches run over the walls. The Almighty ſhall bleſſe thee with the bleſſings of heaven above, bleſſings of the deep that lieth under, bleſſings of the breaſt, and of the womb.</hi> In which places God is ſtill men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the original of this bleſſing, and the ſupreme efficient cauſe of the pregnancy of the womb, and increaſe of poſterity. It was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47058:18"/>the ſame God that ſent his Angel to the wife of <hi>Manoah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 13.3</note> to tell her that <hi>ſhe ſhould conceive and bear a ſon.</hi> 'Tis out of queſtion, that to theſe perſons it was a mercy to have iſſue, yea, a publick bleſſing to many generations; for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the onely viſible Church on earth, the onely people that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Idols to ſerve the living God. And <hi>Sampſon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Manoah</hi> was, in his time, the onely Judge: and Champion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Type of Chriſt. But it ſeems doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore all other parents can call their children Bleſſings; or indeed, whether the faithfull have any ſuch cauſe to promiſe themſelves comfort in their poſterity, without ſome like revelation or teſtimony from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as they had? To this I anſwer, that all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (I mean, that continue in the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>) have exceeding great and precious promiſes to reſt ſatisfied in, that extend to them all, in all ages; I mean, Gods promiſes of giving, and bleſſing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that ſhall be my third proof. If God promiſe diſtinctly, and frequently, that they ſhall ſee their poſterity, and their ſeeds ſeed, then we muſt thankfully enumerate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his rich favours to mankind. This was the bleſsing to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; <hi>God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.28</note> 
                  <hi>and God ſaid unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth.</hi> And to <hi>Noah;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.1.</note> 
                  <hi>God bleſſed Noah and his ſons, and ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47058:18"/>unto them, be fruitfull, and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the earth.</hi> This bleſsing was given them as the common parents and ſtocks, of whom the future generations ſhould ſucceed; and therefore we find it tranſmitted by other Scriptures to ſucceeding ages, and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue while the patience and good will of God towards man continues. Thus the Pſalmiſt; <hi>Loe children are an heritage of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 127.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</hi> Likewiſe in the following <hi>Pſalm,</hi>

                  <hi>Thy wife ſhall be as a fruitful vine by the ſides of thine houſe, thy children like olive plants round about thy table. Behold, that thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.</hi> Again, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath the ſame promiſe from God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus emphatically expreſſed, <hi>I will pour my Spirit on thy ſeed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 43.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and my bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy off-ſpring, and they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſſe, as willows by the water-cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> The like promiſes of multiplying their ſeed are frequently to be found <hi>in other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>

               </p>

                  </note> according to his will, that cannot but be a mercy when it is received. That ſuch prayers were not unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, is certain; for <hi>either ſome of them were ſtirred up by an extraordinary inſtinct of ſpirit,</hi> to ask <hi>that which God hath intended in a ſingular and unexpected manner to give; or the common ſpirit of ſupplication put the innocent deſire of nature into a poſture of acceptation with God; they asking children of him, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more then the uſuall courfe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the general concurrence of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes aforementioned led them to expect. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had received the promiſe of children, but long time being paſſed, and his wife <hi>not yet conceiving,</hi> thoughts began to grow in his mind, what the intent of God ſhould be; and therefore when God doth again renew his convenant to him, he breaks out into this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expreſsion,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go childleſſe?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, thou haſt given me a great eſtate, but I have no heir; and what comfort can I take in all other enjoyments, ſeeing the main thing which thou haſt promiſed is yet behind, and I am ſtill childleſs.<note n="(b)" place="margin">B. <hi>Halls contempl.</hi> l. 10, p. 117</note> And therefore either take away theſe bleſſings, or give me the chief bleſſing of my houſe, even a ſon to be born of my wife. This prayer you know God accepted, and anſwered according to his deſire, even then when his body was old, and his wife, <hi>by nature,</hi> uncapable of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 35.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebeccah his wife conceived, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Rachel</hi> had no children, ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Jacob, Give me children, or elſe I die.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 30.22.</note> The like courſe was long after taken by others, eſpecially by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> who having no children, prayed with no little earneſtneſs, yea, poured out her ſoul in this buſineſs,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.11.17.</note> 
                  <hi>That God would look upon his handmaid, and remember her, and not forget her, and give her a man-child.</hi> And old <hi>Eli</hi> ſeconds this requeſt, and adds, <hi>The Lord of Iſrael grant thee thy petition that thou haſt asked of him.

For though the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> did all deſire that the promiſed ſeed might come of them <hi>(as ſome do uncertainly conjecture)</hi> and had alſo too high eſteem of temporal bleſſings, and carnal apprehenſions of promiſed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings did much poſſeſſe the mind of the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; yet we are now under a <hi>better teſtament,</hi> containing <hi>exceeding great and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of things Spiritual.</hi> If therefore we ſtick too much on the letter of old-Teſtament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we ſhall commit as great an errour in our faith, as the <hi>Jews,</hi> by reſting in the bare let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the precepts, ran into groſs error in their practice.

                  <hi>and to love God though without their mercies.</hi> Let us count riches and poſterity nothing without God, and God ſufficient without either of them.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Repentance the duty of women with child.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>REpentance is never out of ſeaſon, except with</hi> Eſau <hi>and</hi> Judas <hi>we go about it too late.</hi> 'Tis the common duty of all, whether married, or unmarried, whether with child, or not, to renew the daily practice of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but, as the Scriptures abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, it is <hi>moſt eſpecially requiſite,</hi> when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are felt or feared, and dangers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; ſo that it muſt needs be ſeaſonable for women, in this condition, to renew their repentance without delay. For whereas it is unſafe to truſt to our former repentance, leſt it be found defective and unſound, therefore the ſureſt courſe is to repent again and again. Who among the daughters of <hi>Eve</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſin of her who was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, <hi>without ſhame and ſorrow?</hi> And yet while you blame her folly in eating the forbidden fruit, the guilt thereof, without repentance, will redound upon your ſelves. Her ſin was turning from the Creator to the Creature; Repentance is a returning from ſin, ſelf, the world, and the tempter, to God. <hi>And while you carry a burthen in your wombs, then, if ever, you had need to be eaſed of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier burthen of ſin, which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47058:29"/>repentance. You muſt repent of the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of your lives, if you would be provided againſt the danger of a miſcarrying womb. You muſt willingly endure the pangs of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if you would ſafely bear the pangs of your travel. You muſt uſe your ſelf to godly ſorrow in the time of your ſtrength, if you expect any comfort from God in the hour of your pain. You muſt humble your ſelf before God, if you deſire that God ſhould then raiſe you up. You muſt take out the ſting of ſin by repentance, and then afflictions cannot hurt you. In you health re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your ſin, and God will in judgement remember mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I therefore ſubjoyn this duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, next after prayer, becauſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 66.18. Hab. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard iniquity in our hearts, he heareth us not,</hi> but <hi>is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity.</hi> So that if we pray without repenting hearts, we do but mock God, and deceive our ſelves. We cannot draw nigh to him in truth, nor will he draw nigh to us in mercy, unleſs we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our ſelves from iniquity, and be at the greateſt elongation from ſinne that can be.</p>
               <p>But this repentance muſt be univerſal, for all ſin.<note n="(a)" place="margin">

So one ſin cauſes too much injury to God, and brings too much guilt and burthen upon the conſcience, (b)<note n="(b)" place="margin">

If the bird, or the mouſe, be held in the ſnare, though but by one leg, their whole body is in danger. Thus all ſin, and the leaſt ſin, muſt be repented of. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would let the people go, after he had endured many plagues,<note place="margin">Exo. 1026.</note> ſo as they would leave their ſheep and their cattel behind them. So <hi>Sathan</hi> would keep ſomething of ſin in us, which may be as a pledge of our returning to him again. And we would willingly, when we are convinced of the neceſſity of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet roll ſome ſweet morſel under our tongues, and be excuſed in one or two of our incurable ſins; but if we will, in earneſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the <hi>Egyptian bondage</hi> of ſin, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that not a hoof ſhall be left behind us, but all iniquity put away out of our hands, and all our ungodly words left off, and all our wicked thoughts forſaken, and all imaginable wickedneſs mourned for, and by degrees relinquiſhed.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Hyer. Drexelii Gymnaſ paen.</note> As the Dove feares every feather of the Eagle, and the skin of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47058:30"/>Lion ſtuffed with ſtraw will make the leſſer beaſts to keep a diſtance; ſo all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, occaſions, reliques and appearances of ſin, muſt be bewailed, ſuſpected, and avoided. For as a woman delivered of her child is not out of danger while the after-birth remains; ſo a repenting ſoul diſcovering, confeſſing, and forſaking ſome ſins, is not yet ſafe, if there be a reſerve of other ſins. And while your body is yet in any ſtrength, you ſhould ſet about this neceſſary work of repentance, without delay. For the bitterneſſe and weight of ſin muſt be taſted and felt one time or other; <hi>(d)</hi> ſo that, as a Landlord takes a greater fine of his Tenant at firſt, and the leſſe rent afterwards: So the more time, care, and tears you ſpend in repentance at firſt, the leſs it will coſt you to renew it afterwards. But if you ſtill put it off, till your travel comes ſuddenly upon you, at beſt you run a great hazard, and lade your ſelf with ſuch a burthen, and incur your ſoul into ſuch danger, from which it will be more difficult to be delivered, then from the peril it ſelf, of child-bearing. So that if your body and ſoul ſhould both miſcarry, and die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God is juſt,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33 4.</note> and <hi>your blood will be on your own head,</hi> for your former neglect of the time and ſpace of repentance.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, which chiefly concerns your ſelf, the conſideration of the child which you carry in your womb ſhould quicken you to repentance, as ſoon as you feel it quick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47058:31"/>in you: For, as the fancy, and longing of a woman with child doth ſometimes make ſuch ſtrange impreſſions on the child in the womb, that it carries ſome ſign thereof after its birth; and as the hurt, bruiſe, or fall of a woman, in that condition, makes her child ſometimes imperfect, monſtrous, cripled, or deformed, to the day of its death; ſo you ſhould fear, leſt the ſin of your ſoul, by nature, tranſmit ſome like foul diſpoſition, and leave ſome ſuch ſpot on your child, as ſhall be a ſtain to his name, and a blemiſh to your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Leſt your corruptions prove innate qualities in him; leſt you <hi>have eaten ſowre grapes,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You ſhould alſo take care to prevent the curſe of God on your child, for your ſake. Think with your ſelf, if God ſhould ſay to me as to <hi>Hagar,</hi>

                  <hi>Behold, thou art with child, and ſhalt bear a ſon, and he ſhall be a wild man, his hand will be againſt every man, and every mans band againſt him.</hi> Would you not count your ſelf unhappy, in being the mother of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate a child? Have you not alſo read what God ſayes of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Their glory ſhall flee away as a bird from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception; though they bring forth children, yet I will bereave them; they ſhall bring forth children to the murtherer.</hi> The meaning is, that the judgements of God ſhould light on their poſterity in a moſt ſevere
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47058:31"/>and dreadful manner; his curſe ſhould be upon them in the womb, and appear in their deſtruction, as ſoon as they were born. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Prophet being exceedingly troubled at the thought thereof, prays, in the next words;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Give them, O Lord, what wilt thou give them? give them a miſcarrying womb, and dry breaſts.</hi> That is, ſeeing of two evils unavoidable, the leaſt is moſt eligible; let it pleaſe the Lord, if he will not remove, yet to alter, or mitigate his curſe. If I may not pray for good to this people, let me intreat for a more tolerable evil. Let them therefore, O Lord, rather not conceive or bring forth, then to ſee them butchered and ſlain by their mercileſs enemies, or expoſed to ſuch heavy calamities as might make them to wiſh that they had never been, or that our wombs had been their graves. Now ſeeing this is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them for their ſins, and is written for your admonition, fear, therefore, <hi>leſt God do ſo to you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and more alſo.</hi> And for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe miſeries on your unborn infants, <hi>take with you words, and turn to the Lord, that bee may take away all iniquity, and receive you graciouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this practice of repentance, you muſt take heed and beware of the leaven of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for you need not make auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a Prieſt, nor ſeek Popiſh abſolution from a Confeſſor, nor expect their injunction of ſome tedious or ridiculous penance, nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47058:32"/>eſteem penance a Sacrament, nor undertake a fruitleſs or idolatrous pilgrimage, or think to ſatisfie God by ſome good works for any ſin paſt, nor be at coſt to purchaſe an indulgence, or to buy a pardon from that man of ſinne.

               </p>
               <p>Renew this practice as often, and with as much ſorrow and contrition, as you can; and the Father of mercies will <hi>ſurely heare thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning thy ſelf,</hi>

Tis therefore to be bewailed, that whereas in the times of former perſecutions, men would travel by night many miles to one that could acquaint them with any part of the Scripture in the Engliſh tongue, and would give twenty ſhillings for a new-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a load of Hay for the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James, (the Word of the Lord being precious in thoſe dayes)</hi> and yet now that Bibles are cheap,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.1.</note> and children are more generally taught to read then in former ages, yet (I ſay) is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that Proteſtants had need he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to read the Scriptures.

                  <note place="margin">Mark. 10.15.</note> with Selfe denyal and humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on our Father in heaven, he ſhall in time, by thus ſubjecting himſelf to the Divine will in doing or ſuffering, grow very like the Angels and Saints in heaven, and ſhall him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enjoy that tranquility and undiſturbed ſerenity, as will be a kind of heaven upon earth. The truth whereof will eſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this particular caſe of ſuffering any dangerous and painfull afflictions. There was nothing more commendable in old <hi>Eli,</hi> than that pious ſentence of his when he heard of the ruine of his houſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Lord, let him do

Wherefore be not ſollicitous overmuch for your bodily life, or the life of your child; much leſſe ſhould you be too eager in deſiring one of ſuch a ſex: as ſome will wiſh for a Boy, others for a Girle; and that with ſtrange diſcontent at the very thoughts of being diſappointed. But the example of <hi>Rachel</hi> may be a warning to you all. She made account <hi>to die</hi> with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and ſorrow, <hi>if ſhe had not children;</hi>

So what ſhe longed for, ſhe periſhed by. Tis reported of <hi>Agrippina, Nero's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhe prayed, her ſon might be Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The oracle told her, that if he came to be Emperour, he would kill his Mother; ſhe replyed deſperately, let him kill me, ſo I may but ſee him Emperour firſt.<note place="margin">Occidat. modo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> And the event prooved accordingly, <hi>for he cauſed her to be ript up,</hi> that he might ſee the inſide of that womb wherein he firſt lay. <q>I have read alſo of a woman that took on exceſſively, for her child that was like to die; and the Miniſter telling her that ſhe did very unwiſely, for perhaps the child, if it lived, might prove ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47058:47"/>great a croſſe to her, that ſhe might have cauſe once to wiſh, that he had now died.

                  </q> This folly would have ſeem'd ridiculous to ſome heathens, who knew not the will and wiſedom of God, ſo clearly as we may. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates of <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi>

               <p>VVHen, I ſay, it is your duty to dedicate your child to God before it is born, I do not mean a dedication to ſome office in the houſe of God, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did by <hi>Samuel,</hi> (for I ſuppoſe ſhe did it by ſome propheticall inſtinct equivalent to a Revelation.) <hi>But yet this I muſt needs ſay, in ſhort, That it were, in my judgement, a commendable purpoſe in any parents, poor or rich, that, if their child prove hopefull and ingenious, he ſhall be wholly ſet apart for the ſervice of God in his Church. It being ſo known a practice among Heathens, Jewes, and ancient Chriſtians, if they had any thing of ſingular worth, to dedicate it to God. And our Gentry and Nobility are herein guilty of a most irreligious and ignoble practice;</hi> I mean, <hi>to count their ſon and heir, or any of their children, that are well ſhaped, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, above the office of the Miniſtry; as if it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47058:48"/>would be a perpetual diſhonour to their family, to ſet him a-part for God: But, if there be any of their children miſ-ſhapen, make him a Scholar, and, if he be a Dunce, uſe their intereſt to get him ſome preferment, that requires no employment. Surely, the firſt author of the Prieſthood, God himſelf, appointed it to the firſt-born, as his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar honour above the reſt of his brethren, and, for ſpecial provocations againſt God, they loſt it, and it was conferred, by divine favour, on</hi> Levi. <hi>And how plentifull are Hiſtories of the ancient practices of many Nations, eſpecially the Romans, in appropriating the office of chief Prieſt to their Kings and Emperours, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not befitting any meaner perſon. Yea, among Chriſtians, the Prince of</hi> Anhalt, <hi>and other perſons of honour, have ambitiouſly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, and happily performed, the Miniſterial Office. And no doubt, but one reaſon why the Miniſtry is of no higher esteem, is, becauſe divers ſelfiſh needy perſons ſeek the Priesthood meerly for maintenance; and ſo are tempted, by their indigency, to unſuitable courſes, and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhifts; and are uncapable of being ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent as they would, or ſhould be; and alſo are the leſs regarded, becauſe extracted from the meaneſt of the people. And, no doubt, this is one reaſon, why the Nobility and Gentry are more feared then loved, more envied then eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they mind their own honour, but not at all the honour of God; they love their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, till I can hear or imagine any reaſon to the contrary, I ſhall here propoſe it as a thing commendable in any perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, be they never ſo great, to entertain ſuch thoughts in their minds, of devoting their child to God, as did</hi> Hannah. <hi>And I doubt not, but if any of them, who are leſs mancipated to the common follies, would ceaſe a while to idolize themſelves, and ſuffer reaſon and conſcience to ſpeak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.8.</note> 
                  <hi>they would conſider better of it.</hi> But this I ſpeak not by commandement. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a Precept, but a counſel.</p>
               <p>Much leſs ſhould any be ſo far beſotted with Popiſh perſwaſions, or Jeſuitical deluſions, as to think a child not dedicated to the Lord, unleſs it be dedicated to a Monaſtick life. Though <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 13.5</note> while yet in the womb, was appointed to be a Nazarite, yet not by his parents choice, but by the command of the Angel. Therefore let them onely take ſuch a courſe, as have the like warrant.</p>
               <p>Well then, by dedicating it to God, I mean, that which is <hi>the indiſpenſable duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents,</hi> viz. partly in purpoſing, while the child is yet in the womb, that if it ſafely enter into the land of the living, and come
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47058:49"/>to years of maturity, they will uſe all poſſible endeavors that it may be the Lords,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.5.</note> by <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;</hi> partly by ſerious prayers to God in its behalf, that it may be ſeparated to him from the womb. Thus, I ſay, ſhould every mother <hi>beg of God, that, as it is mine by nature, ſo it may be thine by grace; that as I have received from thee, ſo thou wouldſt be pleaſed to accept my dedication of it to thee again.</hi> Some women have ſuch prayers and purpoſes, when their travel fills them with pain, and threatens them with danger; but, if once delivered, they mind them no more. Wherefore, let your duty herein take an earlier date, that it may make better impreſſion in your heart. And aſſure your ſelf, if you thus purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that your child may be ſet apart for God, and become holy to the Lord, it ſhall be with you as with <hi>David;</hi>

               <p>THough care of the body may ſeem to be a matter of ſo ſmall moment, as ſcarce to deſerve a chapter by it ſelf; yet the truth is, it is a duty of ſo great concernment, that it muſt not be excluded, but diſtinctly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by child-bearing women. Certain we are, that life and health muſt be reckoned among thoſe talents which God doth intruſt them with. Becauſe the health of the body contributes much to perfect all operations of the mind: but women with child have a far greater reaſon to be mindful of their health, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely for their own ſakes, but the good of the infant that is yet unborn. If therefore ſome grave Authors have thought it neceſſary,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charon</hi> of Wiſdome.</note> that the Father himſelf ſhould obſerve divers rules of temperance, both in body and mind, if he expect towardly and comely children;<note place="margin">Magirus Phyſ.</note> How much more requiſite is it, that the mother, who contributes far more
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47058:50"/>to the body and diſpoſition of the child, then the Father (becauſe the child, for many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, receives ſuch nouriſhment as the womb, where it lies, affords; I ſay, how much more doth it concern her) to uſe all poſſible cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſcretion, to keep her ſelf in a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and well-ordered plight, that ſhe may afford the better nutriment to the fruit of her womb.</p>
               <p>I queſtion not, but their care herein is as effectual to the ſtrength of their child, as the warmth of the Sun and inriching the ſoil is to any fruit. And as fruit that ripens kindly is gathered the eaſier, and comes off without tearing the branch on which it grows; ſo the child, the more ſtrength it receives from the mother, as the root, and the more vigorous it grows by all additional helps, the eaſier and ſpeedier will its paſſage into the world be.</p>

By which you may perceive, what influence the meat, drink, deſires, and delights of the mother, have upon the future diſpoſition of the child. Wherefore learn it as a ſpecial duty <hi>to forbear

Conſider, what wrong ſin does to the honour of Gods Attributes, and of his Law. His Holineſs requires nothing but what is good, his Wiſdome what is fit, and his Mercy what is comely and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for us. Shall we break ſuch a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Holineſs, Wiſdome, and Mercy appears? If any thing be difficult, he offers the help of his Grace, to all that bewail their weakneſſe. And whatever his Law be, yet ſurely he is our Creator; and therefore, by all bonds of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47058:53"/>Reaſon and Nature, we owe obedience to him, whoſe we are. Again, conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to Chriſt, by piercing him with our Sins, by deſpiſing his Bloud (that onely and coſtly remedy) and diſhonouring his Name, as if he were not ſufficient to ſave, or as if his Grace gave liberty to Sinne. Alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perjury every ſinner is guilty of, in violating our Baptiſmal engagement, and making ſlight account of all other renewed ſtipulations we have made to God ſince. What ſhall I ſay of the ſhame and miſchief ſin brings upon us in this life? It deprives of Gods Image, Favour, and gracious Preſence, robs us of that primitive innocency &amp; righteouſneſs, with which the humane Nature was at firſt dignified above all ſublunary creatures, and degrades us to a condition (in many reſpects) <hi>worſe then that of the beaſts that periſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.12, 20. Eccleſ. 3.18.</note> yea, it makes us children of the Devil, and children of wrath: it fills the creature with vanity, under which it groans and travels in pain; it fills our life with croſſes, our family with troubles, our bodies with diſeaſes, our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with diſquiet. Sin makes travel painful, death dreadful, and hell intolerable; ſo that it is a boundleſs and endleſs evil. And ſhould not ſuch conſiderations as theſe awaken you? May it not trouble you to conſider with your ſelf thus, If I die with all this load of ſin upon me, it will ſurely ſink me deep enough into the burning lake? And alas, if I live till the full
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47058:53"/>time of my travel come (which is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) yet how little a while is it before that fatal hour may ſever my ſoul from my body; <hi>My ſoul,</hi> which is inviſible, and therefore leſſe minded, while my vile body hath been pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and delicately kept; and then I muſt appear before an impartial Judge, whoſe eyes are as flames of fire; and <hi>how ſhall I ſhall eſcape</hi> or endure his ſentence of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>who have neglected ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Oh Eternity, that amazing word,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> that aſtoniſhing thing! who can number the millions of years contained in Eternity?

If there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hell nor Heaven, yet ſin is hatefull and filthy in it ſelf, and holineſs and righteouſneſſe is moſt eligible and amiable for it ſelf. So that, were I never ſo much an infidel, yet reaſon will tell me, that onely piety can beget in my minde true tranquillity.</hi> But ſurely, my Creator is true, and therefore will, in another world, <hi>bring every work into judgement,</hi>

So though you cannot, in reaſon, expect that God ſhould preſently, upon your repentance, give you aſſurance of pardon, yet let it ſatisfie you, that his Word doth aſſure you; and if you expect any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy, he commonly reſerves that beſt wine till the laſt; when you draw nearer to your home in heaven, you ſhall have a clearer fight of his reconciled face.

But at the Reſurrection, when body and ſoul are reunited, the ſentence of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution more publickly pronounced, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked condemned, time finiſhed, and their whole perſons admitted to fulneſs of glory and happineſs; then, I ſay, there is a great addition made to their felicity; then their ſouls ſhall no longer cry, <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true,</hi> as they did before, <hi>while their bodies were under corruption, &amp; the Church under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;</hi> but ſhall be fully ſatisfied with the perpetuity of that bleſſedneſs and perfection God hath crowned them with. But I liſt not here to enter into ſo large a field, as the ſtate of Glory after the Reſurrection.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47058:63"/>as ever I could deſire, yea, have, to my ſeeming, been in utter deſpair for the preſent; ſo that I have been not a little troubled to get them to believe, that their ſins were pardonable, and their ſouls not paſt remedy, &amp; when at laſt they began to apprehend any hope, they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden, ere I was aware, made vows, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to come near ſuch and ſuch compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and places of temptation; yea, have alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded theſe their vowes with immediate earneſt prayer to God in ſecret, for his aſſiſtance: and yet have (to my knowledge) riſen from their knees, and gone immediately to the ſame wicked practice, and been as deeply plunged as before, and then been in the ſame trouble again, make the like vows again, and relapſed in like manner again.

                  <hi>and God would not be intreated to give his bleſſing to that for which he had never given his command.</hi> For though in the Old Teſtament there is as clear exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of paying Vowes, as of offering a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. yet in the New Teſtament, he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned his Miniſters <hi>to teach us to obſerve whatſoever he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded</hi> (though he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend to many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that might ſeem of leſs concernment, yet) gave no inſtruction to his Apoſtles or Miniſters, to preſcribe making Vowes, as a help to holineſs, or a remedy againſt ſin or

To vow to do a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, is needleſs. For his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand layes a greater obligation upon us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And if the thing vowed be uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then it is not neceſſary; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it muſt be <hi>dangerous to lay our ſelves under a neceſſity of doing that which our great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver never made neceſſary.</hi> For this vow of unneceſſary things muſt be either abſolute, or conditional. An abſolute vow layes us under the ſnare of impoſſibilities, yea, under the danger of ſin; a conditional vow carries with it the danger of inconſtancy; <hi>ſuch vows being ſeldome held of much force, becauſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may ſo often vary, that they may quickly ſeem diſcharged of their vowes.</hi> As for inſtance, Suppoſe you make a vow, If God ſhall recover you, to give ſo much to the poor, to read ſo many chapters a day, to pray ſo often, or the like. This is an abſolute vow. And now, if Providence render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to give ſo much, without great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to your family-neceſsities, or to read or pray ſo often, without danger of your health, or omitting ſome more neceſſary and ſeaſonable good; in this caſe you cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly keep your vow without ſin. If your vow be <hi>conditional</hi> to give ſo much, if you can
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47058:64"/>ſpare it; to read and pray ſo much, if you have leiſure and ſtrength: this is needleſly vowed, for you are already bound by your vow in Baptiſm, and by the common bonds of Religion, to give what you can to the poor, and to ſerve God with all your might, and to redeem your time for him. <hi>And tis better to doe what we do for God, out of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious obedience to his Law, then out of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious obſervation of voluntary vows For who hath required this at your hands?</hi>

                  <hi>TO get faith,</hi> and <hi>to get an intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> are great words, &amp; <hi>more commonly ſpoken than understood.</hi> Know therefore, that faith <hi>is not</hi> a beleeving that I am pardoned, or that I have true grace, and ſhall certainly be ſaved, this is not the nature, but fruit, of juſtifying faith. But, <hi>Faith is a believing the Goſpel, which repreſents and offers Chriſt to us, as the onely all ſufficient Saviour, and the receiving him as ſuch.</hi> Faith looks on Chriſt as revealed in his word, to be our Prieſt, Prophet, and King, or <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> Accordingly, it cauſeth us, to renounce our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47058:67"/>to renounce our own Reaſon, and to believe all myſteries of godlineſs, <hi>upon his bare Word</hi> (thus becoming fools that we may be wiſe in him); and to deny our ſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our own wills, and all things that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves againſt Chriſt, and to make his will our ſupreme rule in all our actions. Thus faith receives Chriſt, with all his benefits, graces, laws; yea with his yoke, croſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; counting the treaſures of the world as nothing, in compariſon of the <hi>meaneſt and pooreſt</hi> things, that appertain to Chriſt, and have his name upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that they who thus receive Chriſt, believe in him, &amp; are juſtified by him, yield to Chriſt the <hi>chief intereſt in all</hi> that is theirs; in their underſtanding by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, in their affections by loving him, in their wills by obeying him, in their time, ſtrength, eſtate, and all things they are or have, by ſerving him with their whole heart, their whole ſoul, and their whole ſtrength, all their dayes. <hi>And ſuch have doubtleſſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore if you doubt, complain, and torment your ſelf with ſuch inward feares as would all be removed, <hi>if you once knew that you believed, and had an intereſt in Chriſt;</hi> then ſtir up your ſelf, now, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as he is offered, be willing to be ſaved by him in his own way, let his intereſt prevail in you above all other intereſts; and you ſhall find that, <hi>faithfull and obedient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with him, will ſooner bring comfort than
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47058:68"/>meer complaints.</hi> Be not then <hi>ſlothfull in this buſineſſe, but fervent in ſpirit, ſeeking the Lord,</hi> for increaſe of faith and help againſt your infidelity.

               <p>THough truſting in God exclude not the uſe of means, and Gods providence over us doth not diſcharge us from proviſion for our ſelves, and preventing what we can of the danger and hurt of any approaching evil; yet it ſurely excludes our truſt in any thing beſides him. And therefore, whatever eſtate, friends helps, ſtrength, you have; yet truſt not to theſe. For God onely <hi>brings to the birth, and gives ſtrength to bring forth. Rachels</hi> Midwife could bid hen be of good comfort, but ſhe could not give her the comfort of a happy deliverance. <hi>Miſerable comforters</hi> are Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, Neighbours, and Kindred, if God withhold the fruit of the womb. And if he ſpeak the word (after others have tormented the labouring woman, and tried themſelves with fruitleſs endeavours, and at laſt given over any hopes of ſucceſs) I ſay, if he ſpeak the word, ſhe ſhall ſo on be delivered; for, <hi>He ſhutteth and none can open, he openeth and none can ſhut; he letteth and none can work, he worketh and none can let.</hi> He can let out the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47058:72"/>impriſoned infant, raiſe up the fainting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; bring ſtrength out of weakneſs, and life out of death. Wherefore, furniſhing your ſelf with ſuch promiſes as he hath made to his people in all their extremities, ſtrengthen your faith, hope in the Lord, and <hi>quietly wait for his ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the many promiſes of this kind, I ſhall mention a few which are obvious, and leave you to obſerve the reſt in your own private reading.</p>

The godly have had this confidence in former times, whoſe practice is both a token of our priviledge, and a pattern of our duty. <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.

               <p>This dependance on the Promiſes, which Faith worketh, is abſolute, without limitation of time, meaſure of affliction, or manner of deliverance.

                  <hi>with ſobriety.</hi> This laſt place is moſt full and remarkable: for the Apoſtle had ſaid immediately before, that <hi>the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Now this tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deſerved all miſery, pain, and torment, both here and hereafter, without any hope of end or deliverance: but ſee the goodneſſe and mercy of our God! ſaith he, <hi>notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſin,</hi> God will ſave her; <hi>notwithſtanding the curſe,</hi> God will bleſs her. For the curſe that came upon women at firſt, is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderated, and the rigour thereof abated, even from the firſt denunciation thereof. Though God had newly curſed the earth, yet <hi>he had reſpect to Abel and his offering.</hi> Though
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47058:75"/>he curſed man, yet it is not an onely curſe, but a command and is a bleſsing annext, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat thy bread.</hi> Here is indeed <hi>a curſe,</hi> that their labour ſhould be weariſome; but <hi>a command,</hi> that they ſhould labour; and <hi>a promiſe,</hi> that in ſo doing, they ſhould have bread to eat. So, I ſay, is the curſe upon women, <hi>I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow and thy conception: In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth.</hi> This ſorrow and pain is the <hi>Curſe;</hi> but it is preſently ſweetned with a promiſe of bringing forth. So that notwitſtanding the danger of this Curſe, <hi>Eve</hi> was (through Mercy) the Mother of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children; and <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> you all inherit the ſame <hi>curſe,</hi> yet you are capable of the ſame <hi>bleſſing.</hi> And, in a word, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in <hi>Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> you ſhall find, that though you are a daughter of <hi>Eve,</hi> yet <hi>you ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

               <p>To which purpoſe, a Reverend Author<note n="(a)" place="margin">Biſh. <hi>Hall</hi> cont. lib. 10. p. 186.</note> hath theſe words. <q>Afflictions have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they occaſion God to ſhew that mercy to us, whereof the proſperous are uncapable. It would not beſeem a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſo indulgent to a healthfull Child, as to a ſick. It was to <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife that the Angel appeared, not to her husband— for that the birth of the child would coſt her more dear then her husband.— As Satan layes his batteries ever to the weakeſt; ſo, contrarily, God addreſſeth his comforts to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47058:76"/>thoſe hearts, that have moſt need; As at the firſt, becauſe <hi>Eve</hi> had moſt reaſon to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, for that her ſin had drawn Man into the tranſgreſſion, therefore the Cordial of God moſt reſpecteth her; The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus far he.</hi> And ſurely we cannot imagine any <hi>higher reaſon,</hi> why God ſuffered the firſt ſin to be, and to bring ſo much ſin and miſery upon us; but that the more miſerable we are, the more would the glory of his grace appear, in pardoning and ſaving us in the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. And why would God have ſuffered ſin to bring ſuch pain &amp; danger upon women in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, but <hi>'twas his will, that there ſhould ever he, while the world ſtands, that moſt eminent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and instance of his delivering power.</hi> For thus it hath pleaſed our Supreme Ruler and Creatour, that his ſervants ſhould be brought low, that he may then help them. Of this we have plentifull experiments in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences towards men and women. And if you would be armed againſt deſpondency, and have your truſt and hope in God confirmed, you muſt make great reckoning of thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py experiences of Gods ſeaſonable help, which he hath at any time vouchſafed to you or others. <hi>If ſo be that you have tasted, that the Lord is gracious,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Conſider alſo that God, who is <hi>over all, in all, and through all,</hi> extends his care herein to all his creatures. <hi>There is nothing ſo difficult but 'tis under his power, nothing ſo ſmall but 'tis
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47058:77"/>under his care.</hi> His providence watcheth over the Fowls of the ayr, and the Beaſts of the field, in producing their young. And there is <hi>no more clearer argument, that there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God over all the world, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſpecies and kinds of all creatures in a continuall ſucceſſion.</hi> Inſomuch that we find a ſpeciall expreſſe law in the behalf of Birds in the time of their incubation, that <hi>while the Dam was ſitting upon her egges or young ones,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 22.6.7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhe muſt not be taken, but let go free;</hi> and this with a ſevere charge, and promiſe of much good upon the obſervation of it. And wherefore is ſuch mention made of the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> by the Lord himſelf,<note place="margin">Job. 39.13. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>which leaveth her eggs in the earth,</hi> and takes no farther care of them, contrary to the nature of all other Birds, but expoſes them in the warme ſand to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Sun to hatch them; I ſay, Why is this mentioned, but to intimate the power and care of God, who delivers their eggs and young ones from being cruſhed, and cauſes thoſe Birds ſtill to increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Again, we find that God hath a care of the Beaſts in this condition. Therefore he promiſed the <hi>Iſralites that among their cattel none ſhould be barren or caſt their young.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod 23.26.</note> And though (ſometimes) <hi>the voice of the Lord maketh the Hindes to calve;</hi> that is, Terrible claps of thunder cauſe ſome beaſts to caſt their young ſooner than ordinary; Yet his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth generally watch over every beaſt

               <p>Hence it is, that when God would ſet forth to us the mild and gracious conduct of the Captain of our ſalvation Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis thus expreſſed,<note place="margin">ſa. 40.11.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſheep-heard, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his arms, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> That is, ſhall uſe like tenderneſſe and indulgence to the weak and infirm, as all ſober men do to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are with young.

               <p>To all which, let me adde the conſideration of his <hi>alſufficiency</hi> to help you in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this you will find, if well conſidered, to be <hi>the ſureſt ſupport</hi> you can fix your thoughts upon.</p>
               <p>All creatures, by the inſtinct of nature, and providential gubernation, are apprehenſive of approaching dangers, and uſe the beſt means they can to ſecure themſelves. The ſubtile <hi>Foxes have holes,</hi> the fooliſh Deer their thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47058:79"/>and <hi>the conies, though a ſimple folk, yet make they their holes in ſuch rocks</hi> and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from whence no hand can pluck them. The wary Bird, eſpying the gun or ſnare of the Fowler, mounts aloft, and is ſafe from danger. Wherefore, when you grow bigger and bigger, and your heart grows big with fearful expectations of your approaching danger, ſhould you not pray, that God <hi>would lead you to the rock that is higher then you;</hi> which Rock is Chriſt? Should you not look upwards, and aſcend upwards daily in your thoughts, that ſo you may get above the hurt and peril of any affliction, yea, of death it ſelf? Do you not obſerve, that among crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, thoſe are moſt active and powerfull, that are furtheſt elevated and removed from groſs matter? You therefore extract, diſtill, &amp;c. that you may have the quinteſſence and vertue of any herb more compendiouſly and effectually uſefull in your time of need. You ſee alſo, the water is more active then the dull earth, the aire then the water, the fire then either of the three; and Angels excel (men, and all elements, and all creatures) in ſtrength; and God doth yet further exceed them then they do a worm. Therefore <hi>to whom ſhould you go, but to him,</hi> who onely hath the power of life and death?</p>
               <p>It is <hi>both commendable and common</hi> in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinners, to count themſelves with the Apoſtle, <hi>chief ſinners</hi> (becauſe of ſome peculiar
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47058:79"/>circumſtances they eſpy in their own ſine, which they have cauſe to think are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be found in the ſins of others.) But it is <hi>more common then commendable</hi> in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, to aggravate their ſorrows, like thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>Behold and ſee! Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you, all ye that paſs by? is there any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow? &amp;c.</hi> So perhaps you think there is none ſo like to miſcarry and periſh, none ever more unlikely to live then you. This is, doubtleſs, your folly. For what improbabilities or ſeeming impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can you labour under, which many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have not been exerciſed with and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from? <hi>There is no new thing under the Sun.</hi> Unleſſe you are reſolved to believe nothing but your own unbelieving heart; you may hear and know of many, that have been, as weak, ſickly, bruiſed, hurt, diſeaſed, and ſufficiently afraid, yet have been ſafely delivered. But, be it ſo, that your caſe is ſingular and worſe then ordinary; yet, cannot you ſay with the Apoſtle; <hi>I know, whom I have truſted that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17.5.</note> Believers truſt not <hi>in an arme of fleſh (that is curſed;)</hi> nor do <hi>their hearts depart from the Living God,</hi> but they truſt in him, <hi>whoſe Name is a ſure Refuge,</hi> whoſe Promiſe is a ſufficient Security, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is a ſufficient Motive to do good, and whoſe Power is allufficient to accompliſh it.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis remarkable that in the Old
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47058:80"/>Teſtament God did often exerciſe his hand maids with many improbabilities, before they had any children. As you may ſee in the Stories of <hi>Sarah, Rebeceah, Rachel, Leah, Hannah; Elizabeth,</hi> and others. Now, they <hi>conſidered not their own bodies though dead,</hi> that is, paſt the uſual time of nature for child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, truſting in him who was able to create that which was not, or to quicken that which was dead, they continued in the Faith, and were the joyful mother of children: <hi>We had,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">a Cor. 1.9.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we might learn; not to truſt in our ſelves, but in God,</hi> which raiſeth the dead. As if he had ſaid, the God whom we truſt, is able to raiſe us, and will raiſe us hereafter out of our graves, how much eaſier is it to him to raiſe us out of our preſent danger and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Wherefore God himſelfe is pleaſed, (to ſatisfie us once for all) to tell us, that women with child cannot be ſo hard put to it, but he can deliver them. For when he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his all ſufficient Power, in giving the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſuch a deliverance, as they ſcarce could believe or expect, thus he doth expreſs it;<note place="margin">Jer. 31.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I will gather them from the coaſts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child, and her that travelleth with child together.</hi> That is, though in your return from captivity <hi>ſo long a journey</hi> to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, you may think of many impoſſibilities,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47058:80"/>as, <hi>We being poor and helpleſſe, how is it poſſible but that teeming and labouring women, muſt miſcarry and periſh by the way?</hi> Oh, ſaith God, I can ſtrengthen them, give them a ſpeedy &amp; eaſy delivery, and make them <hi>even in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (without long ſtay and loſſe of time) able to go forward, till they come into their own Land.</p>
               <p>So then, I ſay; If your apprehenſions of danger in your travell, do any way diſcourage your faith,<note place="margin">Zechariah 8.6. Job. 5.9. Rev. 15.3.</note> yet let <hi>Gods alſufficiency</hi> put life into it. If to be delivered <hi>be marvellous in your eyes, yet it is not marvellous in mine eyes, ſaith the Lord of hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though we all acknowledge this in the notion,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Preſton</hi> of Gods attributes p. 196.</note> yet how few are there whoſe hearts are poſſeſſed with the power of this truth. As it is one thing to hear a thing in the notion, as for a man to think what he would do, if he were a Pilot or a Captain; and another thing, <q>to have it in the reall managing, as when he is brought to fight. So it is here. It is one thing to ſay, I believe God is Almighty, and another to thing reſt upon it.</q> For <hi>not onely the ſtub born Iſraelites</hi> did diſtruſt God in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; <hi>and weak women,</hi> as <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 11.21.</note> queſtioned Chriſts power to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> becauſe he had been four dayes dead: <hi>but</hi> no leſs a man then <hi>Moſes himſelf</hi> queſtions how God could provide for ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand in the wilderneſs. Wherefore,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> ſtrive with your unbelief, give to God the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47058:81"/>glory of his Power, Wiſdome, and Mercy; fix the apprehenſions thereof deeply upon your heart, and pray to the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of Faith, to <hi>help your unbelief.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the wife of <hi>Manoah,</hi> after you have mourned and prayed, with any hope of acceptation, <hi>Surely, if the Lord had meant to deſtroy us, he would not have accepted a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at our hands:</hi> Labour for the faith of thoſe men and women of old, of whom it is written, that <hi>by faith out of wekneſs they were made ſtrong, and women received their dead to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet let not the thoughts of Gods all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency paſs without one improvement more, which I ſhall give you in the words of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If God be <hi>All ſufficient,</hi> then learn to be content with God alone; for all deſtrable comforts are in him, as the effects are in the cauſe: as when Chriſt promiſes, that <hi>If any leave houſe,</hi>

And yet there you ſhall have none but <hi>God</hi> alone, ſo that if all this vanity were not to be found in him, you could not be happy, even in Heaven it ſelf.

               <p>I Know very well, that 'tis far more eaſie to preſcribe patience to others, then to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it to our ſelves. And therefore, if I tell women in this condition, that it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them to be <hi>leſs clamorous and vociferous in their outcries and ſcrieches:</hi> they will ſoon reply, that <hi>if we knew what they endured, we would not much blame them.</hi>

Rev. 12.2.</note> I grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the pains of a woman in travel are alwayes expreſſed in Scripture, as the fitteſt compariſon to ſet forth <hi>the greateſt pains imaginable,</hi> as may be ſeen in the places quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the margin. And that the ſame word in the Original ſignifies both <hi>pains in travel</hi> and <hi>pangs of death,</hi> as critical Annotators do
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47058:82"/>obſerve on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.3. And that, in Scripture, the time of travell is commonly expreſſed by <hi>crying out, Iſa.</hi> 26.17. chap. 42.14. And therefore I would not have any pious women to miſ-interupt me, as if I counted it no leſs then ſinful, to utter their complaints and outcries in the midſt of their torments; but I would think it <hi>commendable</hi> in any of them, if they would ſo arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with patience before-hand, that they might abate ſomewhat of thoſe dreadfull groans and cryes, which do ſo much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their friends and relations, that are near them, and do much amaze the hearts, and weaken the hands, of thoſe ſtanders by, that they become the leſs helpful to them. But this is a ſmall matter to what I intend. Give your ſelf what liberty and eaſe you will, by pouring out your groans, ſo you look to <hi>the chief thing,</hi> that is, that your heart be all the while in a believing, praying, humble, patient, ſubmiſſive frame.</p>
               <p>To help your patience herein, you muſt know, that my meaning is not, that you ſhould read, meditate, or perform any labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious duty at that time, but what I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as uſeful to you in that caſe, you muſt conſider of before that hour, and ſo poſſeſs your mind with the grounds and principles of patience, that patience may then have in you its perfect work.</p>
               <p>To which end, conſider, that Sin is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47058:82"/>cauſe of all ſufferings; &amp; therefore, if we underſtood, felt, conſidered the weight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, filth, and future evil of ſin, how could we have the face to complain of any evil but that, or to make any other outcry, but that of the Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> How emphatical are thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Why ſhould a living man complain, a man, for the puniſhment of his iniquities?</hi> That is, ſeeing you are but a creature, a ſinful creature, and yet a living creature, puniſhed, not deſtroyed, puniſhed for your iniquities, which deſerve far worſe; why ſhould you complain, ſeeing 'tis the Lords mercy you are not conſumed? Suppoſe a Ship, after a long voyage, being come into harbour, ſprings a leak; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ſomewhat troubled at it, and is never quiet till it be ſtopped, ſo that it is an evil to him; yet he comforts himſelf in this, that it did not happen to him, when he was out at Sea; that had been a great deal worſe, and might have proved the ruine of them all: So there is this comfort in all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, that they happen to us in this life; we feel they are upon us, but bleſſed be God they are upon us here in this world, ſo that by a ſanctified uſe to be made of them, they ſhall not be upon us in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, whoſe hand it is that inflicts theſe ſorrowes upon you. Your pangs and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47058:83"/>throws, as they were procured by ſin, ſo they are diſpoſed by the Lord. This made <hi>Job</hi> ſo patient; <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.</hi> This made <hi>Eli</hi> ſubmiſſive, when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> told him of the ruine of his family, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> Yea, this made <hi>David</hi> ſo ſilent, <hi>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou Lord didſt it.</hi> So do you reaſon with your ſelves, ſhall not I drink of <hi>the cup of trembling,</hi> ſeeing 'tis in <hi>the hand of the Lord my God,</hi> who wil give me onely ſo much as ſhall profit me, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me? Shall I not ſtand under that croſs that <hi>he hath laid</hi> on my ſhoulders, and ſtoop to that yoke, that <hi>he impoſes</hi> on my neck. Bears and Lions take blows from their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſhall not I bear any thing from <hi>my keeper and preſerver?</hi> Children take bitter phyſick from the Mother, and hard blows from a Father, and ſhall not I be in ſubjection to <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> and live? I cannot, I muſt not contend with <hi>my Maker,</hi> I will therefore humbly bend <hi>to him,</hi> leſt <hi>he</hi> break me, and I will not make my croſs heavier by impatience, then <hi>he</hi> hath made it by <hi>his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look alſo to the <hi>examples of patience,</hi> which are ſuch as will abundantly ſhame us, if we murmure and repine at the hand of the Lord upon us.</p>
               <p>God himſelf is <hi>preſſed with our ſins, as a cart is preſſed that's full of ſheaves,</hi> yet is ſtill <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47058:83"/>and long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that we ſhould die and periſh in our ſins, but turn and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus endured innumerable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, unſpeakable agonies, and intollerable grievances at his death; yet <hi>as a ſheep before the ſhearer, ſo opened he not his mouth, he did neither ſtrive nor cry, neither was his voice heard in the ſtreets.</hi> And, alas, what are yon pains in compariſon of his? The holy Spirit, our ſanctifier and comforter, is exceedingly <hi>vexed</hi> and <hi>grieved</hi> at our yielding to many ſins and corruptions, yet forſakes us not utterly, but <hi>waits all the day long, knocking at the doores of our hearts,</hi> and patiently expecting our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>The holy Church of God hath been, from the firſt planting thereof, continually <hi>toſſed to and fro,</hi> with what tempeſts Satan could raiſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>They have been continually aſſaulted with the wild beaſts of the wilderneſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.36, 37, 38.</note> ſtung with fiery ſerpents, expoſed to wants, hardſhips, dangers, &amp;c. They have <hi>had trials of cruel mockings and ſcourgings, of bonds and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword, they wandred about in Sheep-skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories and Martyrologies are pregnant, with moſt famous inſtances of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47058:84"/>the patience of the Saints, under ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ordinary men have not the hardineſs to inflict, much leſs the patience to endure. But 'tis a tried rule then, which none more certain, that <hi>God never calls his people to any ſuffering, but he will be with them, to enable them to bear it.</hi> But leaſt you ſhould think, that the examples are all of the ſtronger ſex, I ſhall mention only a few (whereas I could many more) of the ſingular examples of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens patience, in ſuch paines, as do, I think, equall the paines in travel.</p>

               <p>But the main thing you ſpeak of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had the advantage, is this, that <hi>they ſuffered for God,</hi> and ſo do not you. But let me tell you, that neither the puniſhment, be it never ſo bitter, nor the cauſe, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good, do make a compleat Martyr without Patience. If this patience be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they be unquiet, murmuring and clamorous under the hand of God, I doubt they ſhall not be ſoon cannonized in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as here upon Earth. Their ſufferings are not accepted if not patiently endured. They do not dy to the Lord, unleſſe they lay down their lives, and offer themſelves a wiling ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; dying out of love to God, not out of unwilling ſubjection to the violence of Man.</p>
               <p>Want of Patience, ſhewes want both of Faith and Love. And if want theſe, we are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47058:86"/>but as <hi>ſounding braſſe and rinckling Cymballs.</hi> If there be any thing we keep from God and reſign not up all readily and intirely to him, we give him nothing, but we love ſomething more then him. But if we part with a little willingly, if we be chearfull givers of our money to the needy, and <hi>honour the Lord with our ſubſtance,</hi> this is thank worthy with God, becauſe <hi>'tis ſuppoſed that</hi> the mortified mind is alike ready, when. God requires it, to part with the whole for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame principle (if a right principle act us) that inclines us to give a <hi>penny,</hi> muſt prompt us alſo to yield up <hi>all, even life it ſelf,</hi> when God requires it. And were there is this habitual forſaking of all in affection, out of acknowledgement of Gods right to all we have, this mental reſolution is with God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative</hi> Martyrdom. So then obſerve, that in all our Actions or Sufferings for God we muſt not lay ſo much ſtreſſe on the thing it ſelf, as the principle, and end aimed at by the doer or ſuffererer. <hi>God alwayes accepts the will for the deed</hi> (when impoſſibilites are the only bars to our per formance) <hi>but he never accepts the moſt coſtly actions or ſufferings without a willing minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The upſhot of all is this, that if we are ſick with any naturall or adventitious malady, pained with any hurtful, or accidental caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when we ſuffer any loſs in our Eſtates, or torments in our fleſh; if then our <hi>patience have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47058:86"/>its perfect work,</hi> if we ſubmit to the will of God, and ly down under his hand, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> under the hand of <hi>Abraham, truſting in his name,</hi> and ſaying, with <hi>Job, though he kill me yet will I truſt in him,</hi> if we bear all cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, out of obedience to him, who diſpoſes and ſanctifies all to his people, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God, <hi>this is ſuffering for God, this is glorifying God in the fires; and the Spirit of God and of glory ſhall rest upon ſuch.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees,</hi> and <hi>be not wearied nor faint in your minds,</hi> remembring that <hi>if you thus ſuffer in obedience to him, you ſuffer for him,</hi> and may lay hold therefore of Gods promiſes to the afflicted, which do equally concern you with any other ſufferers.</p>
               <p>Again, you have ſtrange examples among <hi>the Papiſts,</hi> what the women of that ſect will inflict on their own tender bodies, in their times of pennance. Take but one inſtance, <q>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47058:87"/>chaſtiſements they lay upon themſelves, how much more ſhould you bear the chaſtiſement of your heavenly Father, who is not inſenſible of the ſmart he puts you to, and will not be unmindfull <hi>to give you an expected end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider further, how gracious our God is in his readineſſe <hi>to ſupport</hi> his people under all afflictions. <q>I have read of one <hi>(a) Theodorus</hi> a Martyr put to extreme torments,<note place="margin">Socr. Schol. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and dimiſſed again by him, when they ſaw him ſo invincible. The hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orian ſayes<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ruffin. hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note> he met with this Martyr a long time after and asked him, how he could bear ſuch unſufferable pains, he anſwered, that <hi>at firſt it was grievous,</hi> but after a while there ſeemed to ſtand by him <hi>a young man in white,</hi> who with a ſoft handkercheif wiped off the ſweat from his body, and bad him <hi>be of good cheer,</hi> inſomuch that it was <hi>a puniſhment, rather then a pleaſure, to be taken of from the rack,</hi> ſith when the tormentors had done the Angel was gone.</q> Thus when our friends can do little for us, God can ſend <hi>his Angells, who excell in ſtrength,</hi> to ſuggeſt, comfort, and miniſter help to us. But <hi>however,</hi> he himſelf will alwayes be with us, <hi>to make our beds in our ſickneſſe, to ſupport</hi> our tyred bodies <hi>with his everlaſting Arms,</hi> and to <hi>uphold our ſouls with his free Spirit.</hi> Thus our Saviour promiſes, to all his people in whatever condition they be; <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe but I will come unto you.</hi>

               <p>There was <hi>an host of Angels,</hi> near enough; though the Prophets man could not preſently ſee them.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21.19.</note> (as if utterly undone) her proviſion &amp; her patience, her bottle and her hope were both out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yet there was upon the very place ſufficient ſupply, though ſhe did not perceive it, till her eyes were opened; when therefore your bodily eyes ſhall look round about, and ſee your friends mourning and taking on, leaving you as hopleleſſe, and you cannot ſee any one among them of whom you can ſay, <hi>that perſon is able to help me,</hi> yet with the eye of your faith you may <hi>ſee him who is inviſible, ſtanding at your right hand,</hi> and ready and able to deliver you,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.30</note> when it comes even to <hi>the moſt deſperate extremity.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But to draw to a concluſion. <hi>Above all things labour before this hour come to lay hold on Chriſt, by faith,</hi> and then you will have the like comfort with that good woman in the <hi>Marian</hi> perſecution, who being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bonner</hi> and tried concerning her faith, he threatned, that he would take away her husband, <hi>ſaith ſhe, then Chriſt will be my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> I will take away thy Child; <hi>ſhe anſwered Chriſt is better to me than ten Sons;</hi> I will ſtrip thee of all thy outward comforts; <hi>Yea but Chriſt is mine, ſaid ſhe, and you cannot ſtrip me of him.</hi> So let this ſettle and ſtabliſh your mind, if Chriſt be yours <hi>all is yours,</hi> as far as ſhall be for your good. Though your travel
